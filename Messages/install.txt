                            Thanks for installing Super-Awesome Paste!
                    ===========================================================


You should find a shiny new entry in your context menu, although you may wish to bind the command
"super_awesome_paste" to something more convenient by heading to Preferences -> Key Bindings - User.

Most pastes will not appear modified, by try copying something from a different indentation level
or into a particular file context and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised with the results.
There are currently a limited number of user options available and if you wish to modify any of
these please note that you should restart Sublime for changes to take effect.
