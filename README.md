## Super-Awesome Paste

A Sublime Text plugin that tidies up and contextually formats pasted content.

Super-Awesome Paste is at an early stage and currently supports the removal of copied line numbers, basic indentation and whitespace corrections as well as splitting or merging lines when appropriate, with much more to come soon.

The plugin should be made available through Package Control after the first release, but for those who want to try stuff out now you can do so by copying the contents of *src* to a new folder named *SuperAwesomePaste* within your Sublime Text 3 packages directory, opening Sublime to find the command added to your context menu.

**Requirements:** Sublime Text 3
